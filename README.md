# SvelteKit Apple Music Search

A demo and developer test how easy to create and how fast Static Sites are with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, in this example with [Apple Music API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1) integration.  
A running example of *searching for songs* is at [sveltekit-tailwind-apple-music-player.swissmation.io](https://sveltekit-apple-music-search.swissmation.io).

## What is used

- Svelte / SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- Vercel adapter

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run builds
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
